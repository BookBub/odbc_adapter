# ODBCAdapter

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/localytics/odbc_adapter.svg?token=kQUiABmGkzyHdJdMnCnv&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/localytics/odbc_adapter)

An ActiveRecord ODBC adapter. Master branch is working off of edge Rails. Previous work has been done to make it compatible with Rails 3.2 and 4.2; for those versions use the 3.2.x or 4.2.x gem releases.

This adapter currently works for connecting using ODBC to MySQL 5 and PostgreSQL 9 databases. You can also register your own adapter using the `ODBCAdapter.register` function to connect to a database of your choice.

A lot of this work is based on [OpenLink's ActiveRecord adapter](http://odbc-rails.rubyforge.org/) which works for earlier versions of Rails.

## Installation

Ensure you have the ODBC driver installed on your machine. You will also need the driver for whichever database to which you want ODBC to connect.

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'odbc_adapter'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install odbc_adapter

## Usage

Configure your `database.yml` by either using the `dsn` option to point to a DSN that corresponds to a valid entry in your `~/.odbc.ini` file:

```
development:
  adapter:  odbc
  dsn: MyDatabaseDSN
```

or by using the `conn_str` option and specifying the entire connection string:

```
development:
  adapter: odbc
  conn_str: "DRIVER={PostgreSQL ANSI};SERVER=localhost;PORT=5432;DATABASE=my_database;UID=postgres;"
```

ActiveRecord models that use this connection will now be connecting to the configured database using the ODBC driver.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
